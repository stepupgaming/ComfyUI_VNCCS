# VNCCS 3.2.4 Changelog

This patch release fixes Qwen Image 2.1 adapter selection in Character Creator V2 and restores module update notifications in Control Center. The changes below are relative to `main` (`3.2.3`).

## Character Creator V2

- QI2 Character Overhaul now resolves its installed file from the Control Center model catalog, fixing false “not installed” errors after downloading a version with a different filename. The original adapter remains supported as a compatibility fallback.
- Versioned QI2 Character Overhaul filenames are recognized in both the UI and backend and excluded from ordinary LoRA slots, preventing duplicate application.
- QI2 Viggle Turbo now honors the selected `dmd_lora_name` and uses the Control Center catalog and active installed version instead of constructing an adapter entry with the old v0.2.1 filename. Empty or outdated saved selections fall back to the current Viggle Turbo catalog entry. This applies to Creator previews and workflow generation.

## Control Center Updates

- Restored update checks for VNCCS and VNCCS Utils against published stable releases in Comfy Registry through ComfyUI-Manager. When a newer release is available, the module badge turns amber and an update banner shows the installed and available versions.
- Green module badges now require a successful version check confirming no newer stable release. Unavailable or invalid update responses show an amber **update check unavailable** status.
- Late module-status responses are ignored after the widget is removed or a newer check starts, preventing outdated results from replacing the current status.

# VNCCS 3.2.3 Changelog

This release expands Character Creator V2's style selection into a visual library with packaged previews and persistent user styles. The changes below describe the final release compared with `main` (`3.2.2`).

## Style Library

- Replaced the style dropdown with a card showing the selected style's preview, name, short description, and reference. Clicking it opens a searchable gallery across the full Creator widget, with category filtering and an adjustable card-size slider.
- Expanded the built-in catalog from 40 to 358 styles across 13 categories. Each style includes a description, reference, and generation prompt.
- Bundled 358 square 1024×1024 WebP previews with the node. Images use the cards' dark gradient as their background and quality-90 compression to reduce storage requirements.
- Refined style prompts to describe artistic rendering while preserving the supplied character details, clothing, accessories, background, pose, and framing.

## Custom Styles and Previews

- Added a custom style editor with name, short description, reference, and prompt fields. Saved styles appear in **My styles** and can be edited and reused.
- User styles are stored separately in `character_template/character_styles.user.json`; their previews use `user_*.webp` filenames in `character_template/style_previews/`. These files are excluded from Git and packaged updates so updates preserve the user's library.
- **Generate preview** saves and renders only the edited style using the current character tags and generation settings. Previews always use seed 0 and a square head-and-shoulders portrait; **Resolution scale** controls rendering quality before resizing to a maximum of 1024×1024.
- Generated previews are saved directly inside the node's preview folder and remain available after page refreshes and backend restarts. Generation reports progress and confirms the file has been saved.
- Added a **×** button to user style cards with a deletion confirmation. Deletion removes the library entry and its preview, if present; deleting the selected style restores the default selection. Built-in styles remain protected.

## Persistence and Compatibility

- Preserved legacy style identifiers and custom prompt text when loading existing workflows. Saved selections also retain style metadata and a prompt fallback for unavailable libraries.
- Style library and preview writes use validated paths and atomic file replacement. Failed writes preserve existing files, and a preview finishing after its user style has been deleted cannot recreate an orphan image.

# VNCCS 3.2.2 Changelog

This patch release adjusts Qwen Image 2.1 Viggle Turbo sampling to help reduce visible noise and grain in generated images.

## Qwen Image 2.1 Turbo

- Changed the final raw sigma node from `0.25` to `0.35`. The built-in six-step schedule is now `1.0, 0.9375, 0.875, 0.75, 0.5, 0.35`.
- The adjustment applies to Character Creator V2 previews and all other VNCCS generation paths that use the built-in Viggle Turbo schedule.

# VNCCS 3.2.1 Changelog

This patch release fixes the `inconsistent privileged request origins` error affecting VNCCS actions when a launcher or reverse proxy rewrites request origins.

## Request Compatibility

- Fixed model downloads, custom LoRA management, and character creation being blocked by conflicting `Origin` and `Referer` headers.
- Privileged VNCCS routes now validate `Origin` when present and use `Referer` only as a fallback. The backend fix also supports older UI clients without requiring a frontend transport change. Cross-site rejection, origin-to-host validation, and the existing request-header requirements remain enforced.
- Added regression coverage for rewritten headers, older clients, Referer fallback, character creation, and rejection of untrusted or invalid origins.

# VNCCS 3.2.0 Changelog

This changelog describes the final user-visible and release-level changes in version `3.2.0` compared with `main` (`3.1.2`).
The release adds Qwen Image 2.1 and MiniMax H3 generation, expands character editing, and improves transparency, clothing, emotions, storage safety, and remote ComfyUI sessions.

## Qwen Image 2.1

- Replaced QIE2511 with the `QI2` family in Control Center and the main generation pipeline. Qwen Image 2.1 is the default Control Center family and uses native ComfyUI diffusion-model loading.
- Added the Qwen Image 2.1 INT8 ConvRot diffusion model, Qwen3-VL 8B INT8 ConvRot text encoder, QI2 VAE, and VNCCS Pose Studio QI2 LoRA to the model catalog.
- Added QI2 support to Character Creator V2, pose generation, character clothing preparation, Clothes Designer, and Emotion Studio.
- Added Viggle Turbo generation at 6 steps and CFG 1, alongside standard QI2 generation at 25 steps and CFG 3. VNCCS handles the adapter and resolution-dependent sampling schedule directly; separate Viggle custom nodes are not required.
- Added QI2 cache controls in Control Center, Character Creator, and Emotion Studio, with `auto`, `gpu`, `cpu`, and `off` device choices and `default`, `int8`, and `int4` storage precision.
- QI2 reference conditioning and output resolution are handled separately, so generation follows the requested output area and reference aspect ratio.
- QI2 clothing edits and character preparation can run without the retired QIE2511 Clothes Core LoRA.

## MiniMax H3

- Added a MiniMax H3 family to Control Center, with FP8 Scaled and INT8 ConvRot diffusion models, a Qwen3-VL 32B NVFP4 text encoder, video and audio VAEs, Pose Studio LoRA, and an 8-step Turbo LoRA.
- H3 Turbo uses a 4-step sampling preset with CFG 1.
- Added H3 pose generation and Clothes Designer generation and cloning through ComfyUI's native reference-to-video nodes. VNCCS keeps the first frame as the resulting character image.
- Added H3 body preparation for Character Cloner's Naked set, using the family-specific Clothes Core LoRA, selected resolution, and standard input prompt.
- Added an optional `audio_vae` input to Control Center for custom H3 setups. Model-family identity, audio VAE, and QI2 cache settings are preserved through VNCCS pipes.
- H3 pose jobs encode, sample, and decode their pose lists in separate phases, reducing repeated model switching. Only the required first decoded frame is retained for each pose.
- H3 pose generation, character preparation, and clothing previews use standard VAE decoding instead of tiled decoding.
- H3 per-pose logs include sampling time, dimensions, and CUDA memory usage.
- Added family-specific Pose Studio LoRA selection, including recognition of H3 helper LoRAs supplied through custom catalog entries.

## Character Creator V2

- Added a persistent framing selector with `Cowboy shot` and `Full body` options, used consistently by previews and workflow generation.
- Added 40 visual style presets across Anime Meta Styles, Anime, Animation, Artistic, and Realistic groups, plus a free-form custom style field. Styles are shared between the UI and backend through a single catalog.
- Replaced Creator's legacy tag picker with curated descriptive presets for species, skin tone, body, face, hair, eyes, and distinguishing details. The new catalog includes 61 species presets and supports multiple selections for hybrids.
- Reworked the seven character-trait fields into labeled rows with editable tag chips and a `+` preset button. Manual text, Wizard results, and preset selections update the same serialized fields immediately, including edits made before focus leaves the field.
- Species presets automatically contribute their visual anatomy to prompts in Illustrious, Anima, and QI2. Explicit character traits take priority over preset defaults; custom text and existing breast-size tags remain supported.
- Preset selection recognizes legacy aliases and combined default hair tags without rewriting saved custom text. New-character hair defaults match the descriptive catalog.
- Updated Character Wizard to use the new descriptive preset vocabulary. Character Cloner retains its separate legacy tag catalog.
- Added QI2 prompt expansion through the native `TextGenerate` node. Character fields are expanded individually, original values are retained when an expansion is missing, and application-owned framing, clothing, background, and species details are preserved.
- Visual style references are appended after QI2 prompt expansion so artist names, work references, and custom style text remain intact. Prompt construction removes redundant unit weights and reinforces a single character in a single view with an expressionless base face.
- QI2 Cowboy shot instructions specify a tight crop from the complete head to the upper thighs, with knees and feet outside the image. Prompt expansion cannot replace that framing with a full-body view or derive the base expression from other character fields.
- Added a dedicated downloadable QI2 Character Overhaul LoRA control, adjustable from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.25, with a default of 0.5. It is independent of Viggle Turbo and is excluded from ordinary LoRA slots to prevent duplicate application.
- Improved repeated QI2 previews by reloading the text encoder for each request while retaining reusable diffusion-model and VAE assets.
- Workflow execution reuses a valid saved preview or selected pose without loading generation models unnecessarily. Generation failures report the failing stage, character, node, and model family with a traceback.
- Added prompt logging for preview and workflow generation, including rewritten QI2 prompts and framing.

## Character Cloner

- Reworked race, skin, body, face, hair, eyes, and detail fields into editable tag rows with `+` buttons while retaining Cloner's existing tag catalog and skin choices.
- After a successful upload batch, Cloner offers either image analysis through the existing Wizard or manual character description. The dialog explains the importance of accurate face and eye descriptions for later emotion generation.
- Uploads and analysis results are tied to the current character and selected references; late responses cannot update a different selection or a removed node.
- Cloning preserves saved costumes and unedited character metadata, refuses to overwrite unreadable configurations, and rejects metadata belonging to another character.
- Reference input is limited to 16 images and 16,777,216 pixels for both the combined source images and the assembled grid, preventing oversized allocations.

## Resolution Controls

- Added a consistent `Resolution scale` slider from 1.0 to 4.0 MP in 0.1 MP increments across Character Creator, character and clothing generators, Clothes Designer, and QI2 face generation.
- Character Creator now uses a 9:16 canvas for all generation profiles. Legacy Anima resolution presets are converted to the new area-based setting, which is saved independently for each profile.
- Pose and clothing generation preserve the source aspect ratio and align dimensions to the active model's requirements. A scale value representing 2 MP sets total image area rather than a 2048-pixel square.
- Model changes select appropriate generation defaults, including 1.5 MP for H3 pose generation and automatic H3 clothing previews, and 1.0 MP for other pose and clothing families. QI2 face generation defaults to 2.0 MP.
- Manual resolution choices are retained separately for each model family and survive switching away and back, UI refreshes, and workflow reloads. Saved workflow settings take priority over browser backups.
- Generator synchronization follows the connected Control Center or Emotion Studio, including rerouted connections, and updates serialized state before queueing. Creator's selected profile does not override the generator's connected model family.
- SeedVR model selections and other generator settings are persisted as soon as they change, without waiting for a subsequent mouse release.

## Native Transparency and Background Handling

- Added opt-in `screen_matte` chroma keying with device-resident color matting, connected-detail cleanup, zero RGB under transparent pixels, and a local corpus benchmark. Legacy methods and Balanced defaults remain available unchanged.
- Added an `Alpha` background option to Character Creator and Clothes Designer for QI2, and a `Native` background-removal mode in the generators.
- Native mode requests transparent output directly from QI2 and bypasses chroma-key removal. Alpha is preserved through clothing references, cached previews, emotion editing, and final images.
- Upscaling in Native mode processes RGB and restores the resized source alpha afterward, preserving transparency through SeedVR2 upscaling.
- Removed GAN upscaling from all generators and GAN model display/downloads from Control Center. Upscalers now offer SeedVR and Off; workflows saved with GAN selected migrate to Off.
- Switching to QI2 selects native transparency; switching to another model restores the previous compatible background choice. Manual choices remain stable while the model family is unchanged.
- Transparent references for solid-background clothing edits are composited onto the selected green or blue background. Blue background prompts explicitly request pure blue and discourage purple, gradients, and background patterns.
- SAM analysis and SAM3 detail recovery are now disabled by default. Recovery controls are hidden when Native background mode is active.
- Native and disabled background-removal paths reuse normalized image batches and show previews from saved sprite files when available, avoiding duplicate normalization and preview encoding while still publishing final outputs.

## Clothes Designer

- Added model-aware QI2 and H3 clothing previews alongside Klein9b, with output resolution included in preview caching.
- QI2 text-based outfit generation uses an image-aware edit prompt rewriter with instructions to preserve character identity, pose, framing, rendering style, and the requested background.
- Clone Clothes uses the uploaded outfit reference directly and validates its presence before generation in both the UI and backend.
- Preview caching now accounts for the clothing reference's file contents, effective prompts, resolution, QI2 cache and Turbo settings, and edit-template changes, preventing reuse of stale outfit previews.
- Preview cache identity also includes the selected model, text encoders, VAEs, loader settings, and LoRA configuration. Custom model inputs and externally replaced pipe assets regenerate previews instead of reusing an unverifiable disk cache.
- Fixed seed handling so the selected or randomized Clothes Designer seed reaches the sampler, including seed 0. Older state without a seed inherits the pipe value.
- Restored workflow state now correctly refreshes clothing generation controls, including background and resolution, when workflows load or the connected model changes.
- Added costume deletion with confirmation. It removes the costume's metadata, generated asset directories, version archives, and unshared preview cache; `Naked` and `Original` remain protected. Failed deletion restores the previous state, and cleanup failures report where temporary files remain.
- Deletion waits for pending field saves, blocks conflicting preview operations, and refreshes the serialized selection. Late Wizard or preview responses cannot restore a deleted costume or change a newer selection.
- Custom-model previews reuse an available matching Control Center pipe. If required custom inputs are unavailable, the preview reports that explicitly instead of trying to build an incomplete setup.

## Emotion Studio and Step 3

- Added a QI2 generation profile with model, text encoder, VAE, user LoRAs, Viggle Turbo, and cache settings.
- QI2 edits emotions by detecting and cropping the face, aligning the crop, generating the expression with Qwen Image 2.1, and merging it back into the exact source region with feathered edges.
- Added QI2-specific face resolution and bounding-box controls, plus an editable emotion prompt template with an `{emotion}` placeholder. The QI2 path performs a full edit pass and uses its own controls instead of FaceDetailer denoise settings.
- QI2 face crops preserve source alpha and support both standard and Viggle Turbo sampling. Illustrious and Anima continue to use the FaceDetailer path.
- Emotion previews now show final results at full resolution with alpha preserved. Intermediate raw-result tabs and their duplicate previews have been removed.
- Emotion controls and stage tabs refresh when the connected Emotion Studio profile is restored or changed, while retaining saved bounding-box settings.
- Default face bounding-box dilation and merge feather are now 50 pixels. These defaults fill only missing settings; saved explicit values remain unchanged.
- Emotion Studio reloads changed emotion definitions and source sprite contents from disk, validates character profiles before model loading, and preserves per-pose prompts and shifted seeds during regeneration.

## Wizards and Image Analysis

- Replaced the Qwen2.5-VL wizard and analysis model with `Qwen3.5-4B-Q8_0.gguf` and its matching vision projector.
- Character and Clothes Wizards use text-only, non-thinking inference and no longer require a vision projector. Character Cloner and VL Analyzer use the Qwen3.5 vision handler with thinking disabled.
- Wizard and Cloner interfaces check model readiness before inference and offer an explicit download action for missing or invalid assets. Downloads can repair invalid GGUF files.
- Added model-specific projector discovery to avoid accidentally pairing Qwen3.5 with an unrelated projector. New downloads use `models/llm/Qwen3.5-4B`.
- Wizard inference, standalone previews, and regeneration run through a shared background worker, keeping HTTP and progress handling responsive without submitting the whole workflow. Wizard stages identify their node and request so stale results can be ignored.

## Control Center and Progress

- Control Center now exposes native UNet and custom-model choices for QI2, Klein9b, and MiniMax H3. Removed obsolete GGUF settings and the ComfyUI-GGUF setup dependency from the main UI.
- Custom LoRAs are associated with the selected model family and filtered accordingly; existing generic custom entries remain shared.
- Catalog refreshes retain packaged QI2 entries when a remote catalog is older and filter retired QIE2511 assets. The standard VNCCS catalog falls back to its packaged copy when a remote refresh fails. Catalog paths resolve correctly for linked installations and do not recreate a removed installation directory.
- Updated the Klein9b Pose Studio catalog asset to `VNCCS_PoseStudioKlein9b_V2.2.safetensors`.
- Model downloads report measured transfer progress and downloaded bytes, followed by a separate installation phase. Removed simulated progress based on elapsed time and added compatibility with multiple Hugging Face Hub progress APIs.
- Download status updates preserve focused inputs, open controls, and scroll position. Model-family tabs support keyboard navigation.
- Pose generation and character preparation report encoding, sampling, and decoding progress per image. Counts reflect the actual work being performed, including individual-image regeneration.

## Remote Sessions and Progress Recovery

- Active workflow widgets use ComfyUI's API transport for requests and media URLs, preserving launcher and reverse-proxy path prefixes. Mutable VNCCS responses are not reused from browser or proxy caches.
- Privileged requests validate browser origin metadata before parsing bodies or performing expensive work. Same-origin requests remain compatible with reverse proxies that rewrite the backend Host header.
- Browser preferences, model registries, and pending dependency installations are scoped to the backend and ComfyUI user. Generator previews, cached inputs, live pipes, and progress are also isolated by workflow and node.
- Generator stage snapshots restore missed progress and previews after reconnecting or returning to the app. Superseded responses, old runs, and snapshots from a previous server instance cannot overwrite a newer execution; terminal errors remain visible.
- Single-image regeneration retains sibling previews, per-pose prompts, and the selected preview. Normal execution and regeneration sharing a cache are serialized to avoid mixing results.
- Inactive live contexts and transient workflow caches have bounded retention. Expired results request a new generator run; final character outputs and legacy caches are preserved.

## Storage Safety and Migration

- Character configurations, preview images, and cached tensors are written through temporary files before replacement. Failed writes preserve the previous files and are reported instead of appearing successful; unreadable configurations are not treated as new characters.
- Sprite batches are prepared before publication, with rollback on failure. Full runs archive previous images into version directories, while regeneration preserves unaffected current sprites and existing archives. Post-publication cleanup failures produce warnings without discarding successfully saved output.
- Character storage updates coordinate generation, costume edits, deletion, migration, and canvas repair to prevent conflicting writes or restoration of deleted metadata.
- Added stricter request, costume-field, image-path, and LoRA validation. Filesystem checks reject traversal and symbolic links that escape the allowed storage roots; costume deletion also rejects aliases to protected sprite sets.
- Legacy migration selects the newest sheet for each costume and emotion and preserves existing character configurations, including forced sprite conversion.
- Migration reports partial failures and can retry only failed sheets. Failed status requests offer reconnection without starting a duplicate job; migration and canvas repair cannot run concurrently, and retained job history and logs are bounded.

## Widget Interaction

- Widget styles, palettes, and animation names are scoped to their owning widgets, preventing layout and color collisions between Creator, Cloner, Clothes Designer, generators, Emotion Studio, Control Center, Sprite Manager, and Pose Editor. Hover rules preserve selected-control styling.
- Shared dialogs provide accessible names, keyboard focus containment, Escape handling, and focus restoration, including nested dialogs. Preset controls and help tooltips expose accessible labels and selected states.
- Character and costume loaders ignore stale metadata and preview responses, retain the previous valid selection on load failure, and clean up listeners and polling when nodes are removed.
- Middle-mouse canvas navigation handles pointer cancellation, lost capture, focus changes, and node removal without leaving a stuck drag or interfering with embedded viewers and scrollable controls.

## Runtime and Memory

- Internal generation stages perform ComfyUI's dynamic VRAM cleanup for all model families, including character previews, clothing, emotions, and SeedVR upscaling. Cleanup also runs on failure without unloading reusable model weights; Klein and QI2 release consumed pose conditioning and latents between stages.
- Package discovery can read VNCCS metadata without a complete ComfyUI runtime. Runtime registration reports import failures explicitly and handles pre-registered namespace placeholders instead of silently exposing an empty node list.
- Native ComfyUI node invocation handles `NodeOutput` results and execution-blocking errors.

## Workflows, Compatibility, and Maintenance

- Added updated 3.2 workflows for Character Creator, Character Cloner, Character Clothes, and Character Emotions. Previous 3.0 workflows are retained under `workflows/Old`.
- Added the `VNCCS Style Preview Test` output node, which generates named preview PNGs for every catalog style using Anima or QI2.
- Added regression coverage for model-family selection, QI2 and H3 generation, prompts and presets, trait editing, resolution and settings persistence, native alpha, clothing references and deletion, emotion crops, runtime cleanup, progress recovery, proxy transport, safe storage, migration, downloads, wizard models, widget isolation, accessibility, and package loading. CI now runs the Node.js widget tests in addition to the Python suite.
- Updated package version to `3.2.0`.
- **QIE2511 workflows require migration:** select a QI2 model and its matching assets in Control Center, or use a compatible Klein9b setup. Retired QIE2511 selections produce an explicit unsupported-model error. The standalone legacy Qwen encoder remains registered for existing independent workflows.
- **Runtime requirements:** QI2 requires ComfyUI's native Qwen Image 2.1 nodes, including text generation, conditioning, and cache support. H3 requires native MiniMax H3 reference-to-video support and both video and audio VAEs. Qwen3.5 image analysis requires a `llama-cpp-python` build exposing `Qwen35ChatHandler`.
- **Character Overhaul:** QI2 Creator's default strength requires its LoRA to be installed; set the strength to 0 to generate without it. Native Alpha backgrounds are supported only by QI2.

# VNCCS 3.1.1 Changelog

This changelog describes the final user-visible and release-level changes in version `3.1.1` compared with `main` (`3.1.0`).
The release focuses on secure model delivery, Comfy Registry compliance, and safer Control Center dependency installation.

## Headline Changes

- Hardened VNCCS for Comfy Registry security requirements and added a mandatory security gate to the release workflow.
- Model downloads are now limited to public Hugging Face repository assets and no longer accept or store access tokens.
- Control Center now respects ComfyUI-Manager installation policy, including remote-server restrictions, restart handling, and automatic installation resume.
- Removed BEN2 background-removal support and its bundled implementation.
- Updated package metadata to version `3.1.1`.

## Secure Model Downloads

- Control Center, Character Cloner, SeedVR2, QwenVL, SAM3, and background-removal model downloads now use the reviewed Hugging Face download path.
- QwenVL, SAM3, SeedVR2, and bundled background-removal assets use fixed repositories and pinned revisions where defined by VNCCS.
- Downloads explicitly disable implicit Hugging Face credential discovery.
- Removed Hugging Face and Civitai token fields, token-saving endpoints, and authentication dialogs from Control Center.
- Obsolete VNCCS token-storage files are removed automatically from both current and legacy locations.
- Direct URL and Civitai downloads are no longer supported. Control Center catalog entries must provide public `hf_repo` and `hf_path` values.
- Authentication-required assets are reported as unavailable instead of asking the user to enter a key.
- Character Cloner now uses the shared validated QwenVL asset downloader instead of maintaining a separate network download implementation.
- Removed the direct `requests` dependency from the package.

## Control Center and ComfyUI-Manager

- Dependency installation now uses ComfyUI-Manager's registered package queue and supports both current and legacy Manager APIs.
- Control Center checks Manager's active `security_level`, `network_mode`, and ComfyUI listener address before requesting an installation.
- VNCCS never lowers ComfyUI-Manager's security level automatically.
- When a non-local ComfyUI server requires `network_mode = personal_cloud`, Control Center explains the security impact and requires explicit confirmation.
- If confirmed, only the Manager `network_mode` setting is changed, the previous configuration is backed up, and the file is replaced atomically.
- Pending dependency installations survive the required restart and resume automatically when Control Center reconnects.
- Restart handling works with both current and legacy Manager endpoints and reloads the page after ComfyUI becomes available again.
- Installation progress and completion are tracked through both current task events and legacy queue-status events.
- Module status now relies on the local ComfyUI backend instead of fetching version metadata directly from GitHub.

## Runtime Hardening

- Removed dynamic code execution from the bundled BiRefNet implementation and replaced it with explicit supported backbone, decoder, and refiner mappings.
- Sampler, scheduler, and SeedVR attention discovery now use direct guarded imports instead of dynamic module loading.
- Removed environment-variable overrides for QwenVL, SAM3, and background-removal download sources and revisions.
- Replaced frontend callback binding patterns with explicit receiver-preserving wrappers without changing queue hooks or widget behavior.
- Removed BEN2 from the available RMBG model list; `RMBG-2.0`, `INSPYRENET`, and `BEN` remain available.

## Release Security Gate

- Added a fail-closed source scanner covering credential handling, raw network clients, external command execution, dynamic execution/imports, unsafe URLs, privilege escalation markers, and removed BEN2 code.
- The security scan runs before the test suite in CI and CI now runs on every push, including `main`.
- Added regression tests that verify every mandatory scanner rule and detect attempts to weaken or bypass the gate.
- Security scanner files, their tests, and the CI workflow now require project-owner review through `CODEOWNERS`.

## Compatibility Notes

- Existing public Hugging Face model downloads continue to work without configuration changes.
- Private, gated, token-authenticated, direct-URL, and Civitai catalog downloads are intentionally unsupported in `3.1.1`.
- Workflows that explicitly selected `BEN2` must switch to `RMBG-2.0`, `INSPYRENET`, or `BEN`.
- Existing Control Center dependency installation remains available, but remote or shared ComfyUI servers may require the new explicit Manager policy confirmation and restart flow.

# VNCCS 3.1.0 Changelog

This changelog describes the changes in version `3.1.0` compared with `3.0.4`.
The release adds FLUX.2 Klein 9B support, moves SeedVR2 upscaling to native ComfyUI nodes, makes Step 3 emotion generation memory-bounded, and substantially improves chroma-key cleanup and Control Center setup.

## Headline Changes

- Added FLUX.2 Klein 9B as a complete generation family with its own model, text encoder, VAE, helper LoRAs, conditioning encoder, and Control Center profile.
- Replaced the external SeedVR2 custom-node path with ComfyUI's native SeedVR2 nodes and added guided model downloads directly to Generator Settings.
- Step 3 now lets users choose which character poses receive emotions and processes large emotion jobs in memory-bounded task batches.
- Chroma Key now removes connected and enclosed screen remnants more reliably, produces cleaner edge colors, and can optionally recover foreground details with SAM3.
- Character Creator now offers three persistent Anima resolution presets up to `1024 × 2456`.
- Control Center can install missing custom-node dependencies through ComfyUI-Manager and guide the user through the required restart.

## FLUX.2 Klein 9B

- Added a `Flux Klein9b` family tab to Control Center alongside `QIE2511`.
- Added catalog entries for the FLUX.2 Klein 9B FP8 diffusion model, Qwen 3 8B text encoder, Flux 2 VAE, VNCCS Pose Studio Klein9b LoRA, and VNCCS Clothes Core Klein9b LoRA.
- Added the `VNCCS Flux Klein Encoder` node, built from native ComfyUI conditioning nodes.
- The Klein encoder accepts text plus up to three optional reference images, scales and encodes each connected reference, validates image dimensions, and creates a correctly sized Flux 2 latent.
- Character Generator and Clothes Designer now select the Klein encoder automatically when the connected pipe uses the Klein family.
- Pose generation and clothing generation now select helper LoRAs that match the active model family instead of reusing an incompatible QIE2511 LoRA.
- Clothes Designer can trace the connected Control Center through intermediate pipe nodes and keeps its Clothes Core LoRA synchronized when the active family changes.
- Control Center stores model type, selected model, sampling parameters, and helper assets separately for each family, so switching families no longer overwrites the other family's setup.
- `CUSTOM` mode now resolves its context model from the active family: GGUF for QIE2511 and UNET for Klein9b.

## Native SeedVR2 Upscaling

- SeedVR2 now runs through the native `SeedVR2Preprocess`, `SeedVR2Conditioning`, and `SeedVR2PostProcessing` nodes included in current ComfyUI releases.
- The old custom SeedVR loader and video-upscaler nodes are no longer required by VNCCS.
- Generator Settings now shows native SeedVR2 model cards with installed, missing, downloading, and error states.
- Added one-click downloads for the official 3B, 7B, and 7B Sharp FP16 or mixed FP8/FP16 models from the pinned SeedVR2 repository revision.
- The required SeedVR2 VAE is downloaded automatically when it is not installed.
- Existing settings that reference legacy `seedvr2_ema_*` or GGUF models automatically migrate to the recommended `seedvr2_3b_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors` model.
- SeedVR output sizing is now explicit: `target short edge` controls the shorter dimension, while `maximum edge` caps the longer dimension without changing the aspect ratio. A maximum edge of `0` disables the cap.
- Each source image is upscaled independently instead of being interpreted as a video-frame batch.
- Progress now advances per image, and previews can be appended incrementally during long runs.
- Native node availability is checked before queueing. When ComfyUI is too old, the UI identifies the missing nodes and asks the user to update and restart ComfyUI.

## Emotion Studio and Step 3

- Added a `Generate poses` selector to Emotion Studio with individual pose toggles, `SELECT ALL`, and `CLEAR ALL` actions.
- Pose selection is serialized in the workflow and restored when the workflow is reopened.
- The confirmation dialog now reports the selected emotion, costume, and pose counts together with the resulting image total.
- Only selected source poses are loaded and expanded into emotion tasks; clearing every pose blocks the queue with a clear validation message.
- Emotion tasks are now processed in small batches selected from available VRAM, system RAM, source resolution, and task count.
- Added an advanced `task_batch_size` setting. `0` chooses a safe size automatically, while manual values are capped when they exceed the detected memory budget.
- Full-resolution source sprites are loaded lazily per task instead of being decoded and duplicated for every selected emotion in advance.
- Raw results and masks are cached per item, completed output files are reused when possible, and successful cache files are preserved during later batches or regeneration.
- Generator previews are reduced in size and emitted incrementally, while full-resolution sprites continue to be saved to the character directory.
- Full-resolution output tensors are retained only when the corresponding `IMAGE` output is connected. The bundled Step 3 workflow therefore stays within the active task window instead of accumulating the entire run in memory.
- CPU and GPU caches are released between task batches, substantially reducing out-of-memory failures on large costume, pose, and emotion combinations.
- Changing the pose or emotion task list invalidates incompatible stage cache data without discarding unrelated saved character output.

## Chroma Key and SAM3 Detail Recovery

- Retuned the `soft`, `balanced`, `strong`, `aggressive`, and `maximum` cleanup presets for a safer tolerance scale and cleaner silhouettes.
- Added connected-component cleanup for screen-colored fringes and broad residual background patches connected to the image border.
- Enclosed regions that are confidently classified as background can now be removed without erasing similarly colored opaque foreground details.
- Edge decontamination now replaces screen-contaminated RGB with nearby trusted foreground colors, reducing green, blue, or red halos around hair, clothing, and outlines.
- `Despill Strength` now controls all edge color correction consistently; setting it to zero no longer leaves hidden decontamination active.
- Improved matte cleanup, foreground recovery, edge choke, and color-bleed behavior while preserving the original image dimensions and output modes.
- Added an optional `Use SAM3 Recovery Mask` input to `VNCCS Chroma Key`.
- SAM3 recovery now evaluates individual detected objects, keeps only masks with sufficient overlap with the existing foreground, and restores their interior details without manufacturing a new contour.
- SAM3 mask outputs with varying ranks, wrapper axes, object counts, or spatial resolutions are normalized automatically.
- Batch recovery runs one image at a time while keeping the model loaded, avoiding third-party tensor-stack failures when images have different detection counts.
- If SAM3 is missing, incompatible, or fails during recovery, VNCCS falls back to normal chroma keying instead of failing the generation.
- Easy SAM3 recovery is marked unsupported on macOS because its current dependencies require decord and Triton; normal chroma keying remains available there.

## Character Creator

- Added Anima resolution presets to Generator Settings:
  - `Normal`: `640 × 1536`.
  - `High`: `856 × 2048`.
  - `Maximum`: `1024 × 2456`.
- The selected Anima resolution is saved in the mode profile and restored when switching between Anima and Illustrious.
- Missing or invalid legacy resolution values safely fall back to `Normal`.
- The higher presets clearly warn that they require more VRAM and generation time.
- Automatic race, body, and skin-color hint detection now follows the documented English input vocabulary consistently.

## Control Center and Setup

- Missing dependencies can now be installed individually or with `Install all` through ComfyUI-Manager and Comfy Registry.
- Control Center supports both current and legacy ComfyUI-Manager queue APIs and reports Manager rejection or installation errors in the UI.
- Successful installations are tracked until completion, after which Control Center shows a restart-required dialog with `Later` and `Restart server` actions.
- Dependency detection now checks ComfyUI's active node registry and all configured custom-node roots instead of assuming a single installation directory.
- Platform compatibility warnings are displayed separately from missing or partially loaded dependencies.
- Model downloads now respect ComfyUI's configured folder paths for diffusion models, text encoders, VAEs, and LoRAs.
- Downloads are staged beside their final destination, validated, and installed with an atomic replacement to avoid cross-volume moves and partially visible model files.
- Download request and worker errors are surfaced in both the Control Center interface and server log.
- Mutable Control Center data such as user configuration, custom LoRA records, and installed-version records is now stored under the ComfyUI user directory when available. Existing portable-install files remain readable for compatibility.
- Family-specific assets are filtered by the active QIE2511 or Klein9b tab, while global utility assets remain shared.

## Compatibility and Maintenance

- Package metadata has been updated from `3.0.4` to `3.1.0`.
- Existing QIE2511 workflows remain the default and legacy Control Center model selections are migrated into the QIE2511 family state.
- Character Cloner's missing-source-image validation is now consistently shown in English in both the backend and UI.
- Added regression coverage for Klein conditioning, model-family state, native SeedVR sizing and downloads, Step 3 batching and pose filtering, Anima resolutions, dependency installation, and the new chroma-key recovery paths.

# VNCCS 3.0.4 Changelog

This changelog describes the changes in version `3.0.4` compared with `3.0.3`.
This release restores the missing Face Detailer denoise control in VNCCS Emotions Generator.

## Headline Changes

- The `Face Detailer Denoise` slider is visible in the Emotions Generator interface again.
- Denoise is stored as a local emotion-generation setting and is passed directly to FaceDetailer.
- The slider once again shows weak, optimal, and excessive strength zones for the active generation model.
- New Emotions Generator nodes and the bundled Step 3 workflow use a default denoise value of `0.55`.

## Emotions Generator

- Restored the dedicated `Emotion Strength` panel that was accidentally removed in `3.0.3`.
- Changing the slider now updates the serialized `face_denoise` setting instead of relying on the connected pipe value.
- Existing workflows without `face_denoise` remain compatible and receive the default value automatically.

# VNCCS 3.0.3 Changelog

This changelog describes the changes in version `3.0.3` compared with `3.0.2`.
The release focuses on complete generator configuration, safer emotion background cleanup, and more precise SAM3 detail recovery.

## Headline Changes

- Character Creator, Character Cloner, Clothes Generator, and Emotions Generator now provide a dedicated `Generator Settings` modal for their internal processing controls.
- Generator settings can be restored with `Load Defaults` and are written only after the user confirms them with `Apply`.
- Emotion generation now preserves the original sprite outside the FaceDetailer region instead of chroma-keying the complete image.
- SAM3 detail recovery now evaluates individual detected objects and rejects background objects before restoring image details.
- The bundled Step 3 Character Emotions workflow now uses the updated FaceDetailer defaults.

# VNCCS 3.0.2 Changelog

This changelog describes the changes in version `3.0.2` compared with `3.0.1`.
The release focuses on Clothes Designer preview execution, Control Center catalog freshness, and SAM3 batch stability.

## Headline Changes

- Clothes Designer previews now work with the `CUSTOM` Control Center configuration by executing the connected workflow branch, so externally supplied `MODEL`, `CLIP`, and `VAE` inputs are used correctly.
- Clothes Designer is now a valid ComfyUI partial-execution target, fixing the `Prompt has no outputs` error when generating a custom preview.
- SAM3 detail recovery now processes image batches one image at a time, fixing tensor-stack failures when different images produce different numbers of detections.
- The bundled Control Center catalog has been updated to the current model list and is automatically refreshed after a newer catalog is loaded from Hugging Face.

## Clothes Designer

- `Generate Preview` in `CUSTOM` mode now queues only the graph required to execute the connected Clothes Designer node instead of calling the standalone preview endpoint.
- Custom previews now use the model stack and settings supplied through the connected Control Center pipe.
- Preview generation waits for the `vnccs.preview.updated` event before refreshing the displayed image.
- Execution errors, interruptions, and preview timeouts are now reported by the Clothes Designer UI.
- Clothes Designer is now marked as an output node so ComfyUI accepts it as the destination of partial graph execution.

## Control Center and Model Catalog

- Updated the packaged `control_center.json` to match the current remote catalog.
- A successfully downloaded Control Center catalog is now written back to the packaged fallback file, preventing an older bundled catalog from reappearing after model updates or remote access failures.
- Packaged catalog updates use a lock and atomic file replacement so concurrent reads cannot observe a partially written JSON file.
- The packaged file is left untouched when the downloaded catalog has not changed, and synchronization failures no longer prevent Control Center from using the downloaded data.

## Chroma Key and SAM3 Recovery

- SAM3 recovery segmentation now runs separately for every image in a batch.
- This avoids `torch.stack` failures in Easy SAM3 when detection-box counts or shapes differ between batch items.
- The SAM3 model is loaded once, retained between images, and released after the final image in the batch.
- Recovered masks are normalized per image and concatenated back into the original batch order.

## Reliability and Maintenance

- Added regression coverage for atomic packaged-catalog synchronization and remote catalog refresh.
- Added checks that the bundled catalog selects Clothes Core `0.3.7` and no longer exposes the obsolete Emotion Core entry.
- Added frontend contract coverage for custom partial preview execution.
- Added a regression check that Clothes Designer remains a valid output target.
- Added batch recovery coverage that reproduces the variable-detection SAM3 failure.
- Updated test environment model-path stubs for the current Control Center behavior.
- Updated package version metadata from `3.0.1` to `3.0.2`.

# VNCCS 3.0.1 Changelog

This changelog describes the user-visible changes in version `3.0.1` compared with `3.0.0`.
It focuses on workflow behavior and UI changes, not internal refactors.

## Headline Changes

- SeedVR upscaling now exposes a color-correction selector in the generator UI.
- Emotion Studio and Character Creator V2 now use the same seed behavior as Clothes Designer: `seed = 0` can stay fixed, and randomization happens on queue only when random mode is enabled.
- Illustrious turbo mode now works consistently across Emotion Studio, Character Creator V2, and Control Center: enabling turbo sets `steps = 4` and `cfg = 1`, disabling it restores the previous values.
- Emotion Studio no longer uses a separate prompt-style selector in the widget header; prompt style is now derived automatically from the selected generation model.
- Control Center now shows Turbo LoRA as an inline selector in the `MODEL` section instead of a separate `Turbo Model` card.

## Character Generator

- Added a SeedVR color-correction selector with multiple modes such as `lab`, `adain`, `wavelet`, and `none`.
- Added help text so users can more easily switch away from `lab` when a GPU produces unwanted color shifts.

## Emotion Studio

- Removed the old top-left prompt-style selector from the widget.
- Prompt style is now chosen automatically from the selected generation mode: `Anima` mode uses the Anima prompt path, while `Illustrious` mode uses the SDXL-style prompt path.
- The seed field is now shared between Anima and Illustrious profiles so both modes show and use the same seed.
- Random seed mode now generates a new seed only when the workflow is queued, instead of rewriting the seed immediately in the UI.
- The Illustrious turbo toggle now stores the previous `steps/cfg`, switches to `4 / 1` while enabled, and restores the saved values when disabled.
- The LoRA section now stays available for both generation modes and updates its header and card set to match the active mode.

## Character Creator V2

- Seed handling now matches Clothes Designer semantics more closely.
- Default generation seed values are now initialized to `0` in fixed mode instead of being auto-randomized.
- Backend seed resolution now respects `seed_mode`, which keeps preview generation, pipe generation, and sampler execution consistent.
- The Illustrious turbo toggle now behaves like the other updated widgets: it saves previous `steps/cfg`, applies `4 / 1` while active, and restores the earlier values when turned off.

## Control Center

- `CUSTOM` pass-through mode now expects external `MODEL`, `CLIP`, and `VAE` inputs together, instead of showing the normal internal CLIP/VAE asset cards.
- Turbo LoRA has been moved into the `MODEL` block as a flat inline selector under the model and parameter area.
- The old standalone `Turbo Model` section has been removed.
- Turbo is no longer force-enabled just because `steps/cfg` happen to be `4 / 1`.
- Toggling Turbo LoRA on now saves the current `steps/cfg` and applies `4 / 1`; toggling it off restores the saved values.
- Hovering the Turbo LoRA selector no longer makes the toggle visually jump.
- Dependency/setup status can now show warning states more clearly instead of treating every non-OK condition as a hard failure.

# VNCCS 3.0.0 Changelog

This changelog describes the user-visible changes in the current branch compared with `main`.
It focuses on workflow and system behavior, not on internal code changes.

## Headline Changes

- VNCCS has moved from a collection of separate sheet-based workflows to a guided end-to-end character production pipeline.
- The main workflow is now built around Control Center, Character Creator V2, Character Cloner, Clothes Designer, Emotion Studio, Pose Studio, and Migration Assistant.
- Models and required workflow assets can now be downloaded and checked from VNCCS Control Center instead of being installed manually step by step.
- The new pipeline is no longer locked to the old fixed 12-pose character sheet format.
- Characters are now produced and managed as individual sprites, so pose count, sprite count, and sprite dimensions can vary by workflow and by character.
- Individual generated images can be regenerated without restarting the whole workflow.
- Existing VNCCS characters can be moved into the new format through the Migration Assistant.

## New Workflow Structure

- VNCCS 3.0 introduces a smaller and clearer workflow set:
  - Migration Assistant for old projects.
  - Character Creator for new characters.
  - Character Cloner for characters based on an existing image.
  - Character Clothes for outfit sets.
  - Character Emotions for expression sets.
- The old multi-step sheet workflow has been replaced by workflows that are closer to the actual creative process: create or clone a character, choose poses, generate sprites, add clothes, then add emotions.
- The old final sprite-extraction step is no longer a normal part of the flow because sprites are created directly.
- The old LoRA dataset generation workflow is no longer part of the main 3.0 production path.
- Workflow setup is less manual: the new UI widgets expose the choices users actually need instead of requiring them to edit many nodes directly.

## Control Center

- VNCCS Control Center is now the central place for preparing a workflow before generation.
- Users can choose a generation setup that matches their hardware and let Control Center download the required assets.
- Control Center shows whether required assets are already installed or missing.
- Control Center also helps detect incomplete setup, missing helper components, and authentication/token issues before the user starts a long generation.
- Generation settings such as quality, speed, optional style add-ons, and repeatability are now gathered into one shared workflow control area.
- This reduces the need to manually wire or edit many separate model and setting nodes in every workflow.

## Pose Studio

- VNCCS 3.0 workflows now use Pose Studio as the main pose authoring tool.
- Users can choose how many poses they need instead of being restricted to a fixed 12-pose sheet.
- The rest of the workflow now receives exactly the poses the user selected, which lets the pipeline work with any pose count.
- Users can create custom poses, adjust body proportions, age, height, body type, camera framing, and character proportions before generation.
- A reference image can be imported to extract or match a pose, making it easier to reproduce an existing stance.
- Pose Studio is used consistently across character creation, cloning, and clothing generation, so the same pose logic can carry through the whole project.

## Character Creation

- Character Creator V2 replaces the old first-step character setup with a more complete character design panel.
- Users can create a new character, select the generation style, and define the character from structured fields instead of editing raw prompts across the workflow.
- Tag builders are available for common character attributes, reducing prompt setup friction.
- Character Wizard can turn a natural-language character idea into structured character settings.
- The NSFW/base-clothing choice is now part of the character creation workflow instead of being handled as an afterthought.
- Generate Preview lets users test the character look before launching the full multi-pose generation.
- Preview generation can be repeated while editing tags, style, or character details, which makes iteration much faster.
- Existing generated sprites can be previewed from the creator UI, so users can quickly inspect the current character state.

## Character Cloning

- A dedicated Character Cloner workflow has been added for creating a VNCCS character from an existing image.
- Users can start from an image generated elsewhere, a downloaded character image, a screenshot, or their own art.
- The cloner can analyze the source image and help produce captions/tags instead of forcing the user to describe everything manually.
- Cloned characters use the same Pose Studio flow as newly created characters, so they can be converted into the same flexible sprite set.
- Users can optionally generate separate undressed/base sprites for cloned characters, which makes later outfit generation easier.
- Background color selection is now part of the clone workflow, helping avoid cleanup problems when the character has colors similar to the background.

## Clothing Workflow

- Character Clothes is now a dedicated workflow centered on Clothes Designer.
- Users can create as many outfit sets as they need for a character.
- Clothing is described through structured areas such as main clothes, headwear, face accessories, shoes, and extra details.
- Clothes Wizard can turn a simple clothing idea into a detailed outfit description.
- Clothes can now be cloned from a reference image, including an image of another character wearing the outfit.
- Generate Preview lets users check an outfit on the character before running the full pose set.
- Outfit details such as headwear and face accessories are carried forward so they can be respected later during emotion generation.
- The workflow can use an existing character sprite as the visual source for outfit generation, making clothing creation more consistent with the character's actual look.

## Emotion Workflow

- Emotion generation has moved into a dedicated Emotion Studio workflow.
- Users choose the character, the costumes to process, and the emotions to generate from a visual emotion library.
- Multiple costumes can be selected for emotion generation in one workflow.
- Custom emotions can be added when the built-in list does not contain the needed expression.
- Emotion generation works from the character's existing sprites instead of from a fixed sheet.
- Users can test a small subset of costumes and emotions first, then scale up once the settings look right.
- Face Detailer Denoise is exposed as an important creative control: lower values preserve the character more, higher values push the expression harder.
- Emotion prompts now take costume details into account, which helps preserve glasses, masks, hats, and other visible accessories.
- Emotion preview assets have been refreshed and moved to a lighter image format for the new visual selector.

## Sprite-Based Character Format

- Characters are now stored and used as individual transparent sprites rather than one large character sheet.
- Sprites are organized by character, costume, and emotion.
- New sprites can have different dimensions; the system normalizes canvases where needed instead of assuming every image comes from the same sheet layout.
- Generation can continue with whatever pose set the user selected, which is what makes arbitrary pose counts possible.
- Generated sprite outputs are easier to inspect, replace, and reuse outside VNCCS.
- Existing results are preserved through versioning when new output replaces an older set.
- Sprite loading and previewing now use the current sprite set directly, making the new format the default behavior across the workflow.

## Regeneration and Iteration

- VNCCS 3.0 adds regeneration for individual failed images.
- Users can regenerate a single sprite instead of rerunning the full character, clothing, or emotion workflow.
- Users can also restart generation from the part of the process that needs fixing, keeping earlier successful work intact.
- Regeneration is available from the generator UI with progress feedback.
- The workflow automatically updates the affected result after regeneration, so the user can keep iterating from the same screen.
- This is especially important for long runs with many poses, many outfits, or many emotions, where a single bad image used to waste the whole batch.

## Background Removal and Cleanup

- Background cleanup is now integrated into the main generators instead of being a separate manual concern.
- Users can choose cleanup strength presets depending on how aggressive the background removal should be.
- Detail recovery can be enabled when background removal damages important character details.
- This helps preserve eye color, clothing edges, hair details, and accessories that are close to the background color.
- Upscaling can be selected, changed, or disabled from the generator settings.
- The workflow gives stage previews and progress information so users can see where a generation currently is.

## Migration From Older VNCCS Projects

- VNCCS now includes a Migration Assistant workflow for old characters.
- Migration is explicit: old characters are not silently moved or modified during startup.
- Users can scan old VNCCS characters, select which ones to migrate, and run migration from the UI.
- Old character sheets can be converted into the new sprite-based format.
- Migration can also repair sprite canvas mismatches so old assets behave better in the new workflow.
- Users are expected to verify migrated characters before deleting old folders.
